AI-Door Man
Requirements: 
•	Python 3
•	Node Red 
•	Raspberry PI
•	Raspberry PI Camera 
•	Servo (for lock/unlock purposes)
•	Speaker 
•	Ultrasonic Sensor (For motion detection)
•	Android Phone 

Description: 
                    The use case our team worked on is AI-Door man. The whole idea of this project is to create a smart door and attach a camera to this door. This camera is triggered by an ultrasonic sensor that senses someone approaching the door. Once the image is taken, it processed locally on a Raspberry Pi system using python code for facial recognition. After this process the image is pushed to the firebase cloud, which triggers the notification on the android app. The user can use the app to perform several functions, for example lock and unlock the door, and interact with the person at the door with verbal statements. These verbal statements are generated by converting text description into verbal statements. 

  
Open source Libraries Used:
  OpenCV 
  DLIB (modren C++ tool kit with machine learning algorithms)
  Face_recognition (face recognition library)
